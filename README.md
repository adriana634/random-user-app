## Key Features
- **User List Screen:** Displays a list of randomly generated users.
- **Search Functionality:** Allows users to search for specific users by name or email.
- **User Details Screen:** Provides detailed information about a selected user.

## Code Overview
The codebase follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, separating concerns and promoting maintainability. Key components include:
- `UserListScreen:` Composable function for the main screen displaying the user list.
- `UserDetailsScreen:` Composable function for the screen showing detailed user information.
- `UserListViewModel:` ViewModel managing user data and interactions.
- `UserListItemViewModel:` ViewModel responsible for managing individual user item data and interactions within the user list.
- `RandomUserManager:` Manager class handling network operations related to random users.
- `Result:` Custom sealed class representing success or error outcomes.

## Best Practices
RandomUser Android app adheres to a set of best practices to ensure code maintainability, scalability, and a delightful user experience. Here are the key best practices implemented:
- **MVVM Architecture:** Adopting the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, the codebase is structured to separate concerns and promote modularity. This architecture enhances readability, maintainability, and facilitates easier testing of individual components.
- **Coroutines:** Leveraging Kotlin coroutines, the app handles asynchronous operations efficiently. Coroutines provide a concise and expressive way to manage concurrency, leading to a smoother and more responsive user experience.
- **Compose UI:** Embracing Jetpack Compose, the app employs a modern and declarative approach to UI development. Compose simplifies the UI creation process, making it more intuitive and less error-prone compared to traditional XML-based layouts.
- **Error Handling:** Ensuring robust error handling mechanisms in network operations to provide meaningful feedback to users in case of failures. This improves the user experience by gracefully handling unexpected scenarios.
- **Testing:** Expanding test coverage to ensure a robust and reliable application. Comprehensive testing helps catch and prevent regressions, ensuring that the app functions as expected across different scenarios.
- **Code Comments:** Adding detailed comments to enhance code documentation. Well-commented code facilitates collaboration among developers, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the codebase.

## Improvements
RandomUser Android app is continuously evolving, and here are the key areas identified for improvement:
- **Error Handling:** The app is actively working on enhancing error handling in network operations. This improvement aims to provide more insightful and user-friendly error messages, ensuring a better experience for users in case of network-related issues.
- **Testing:** The app is committed to expanding its test coverage. Comprehensive testing is crucial for identifying and addressing potential issues, ensuring the app's reliability and stability across various scenarios.
- **Code Comments:** In an effort to promote code transparency and collaboration, the team is working on adding detailed comments throughout the codebase. This improvement aids developers in understanding, maintaining, and extending the code more effectively.
- **Custom Result Implementation:** The ongoing development of the custom Result implementation aims to introduce a property for obtaining success data. This addition emphasizes the importance of separation of concerns (SoC) by providing a more modular and flexible approach to handling success cases. With this enhancement, developers will have the capability to access success data directly, promoting clearer and more modular code organization. This separation of concepts ensures that success data retrieval remains distinct from other error-handling mechanisms, contributing to a more maintainable and comprehensible codebase.

## TODO
The RandomUser Android app is a work in progress, and there are several interesting features and enhancements planned for the future. Here's a glimpse of what's on the horizon:
- **Infinite Scroll Functionality:** Implement infinite scroll functionality for a smoother and seamless user experience. This feature ensures that users can continuously explore and load more random users as they scroll through the list.
- **Action Bar Addition:** Enhance the app's navigation and user interaction by adding an action bar. The action bar serves as a central hub for accessing key functionalities, providing a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.
- **Additional Testing:** Expand the testing suite to cover both unitary and functional aspects of the application. Thorough testing ensures the app's robustness, identifying and addressing potential issues before they reach end-users.
- **Code Comments:** Continue adding detailed comments throughout the codebase. Comprehensive comments contribute to better code understanding, maintenance, and collaboration among developers.

## Dependencies
RandomUser doesn't stand alone; it's powered by an ensemble of dependencies. Each library brings its unique capabilities, contributing to the overall functionality and user experience.

### Jetpack Compose
Jetpack Compose is the backbone of the user interface, providing a modern and declarative way to build UIs in Android applications. Its concise syntax and powerful features simplify UI development and enhance the overall user experience.

### Retrofit
Retrofit is used for handling network operations, making it easy to consume RESTful APIs. It simplifies the process of fetching and sending data over the network, ensuring a smooth and efficient data exchange between the app and the server.

### OkHttp
OkHttp serves as the HTTP client for network requests. It works seamlessly with Retrofit, providing advanced features such as connection pooling, response caching, and efficient request/response handling.

### Coil
Coil is employed for image loading in the app. Its lightweight and fast image loading library efficiently handles image loading, caching, and displaying, contributing to a seamless user experience when viewing user profile pictures.

### Google Maps
Google Maps integration enhances the app by providing location-based services and maps. Users can explore geographical details, adding a layer of interactivity and engagement to the RandomUser app.

Each dependency is carefully chosen to bring efficiency, reliability, and enhanced functionality to the RandomUser Android app. For a detailed view of these dependencies and their versions, refer to the [build.gradle](./app/build.gradle) file.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Add your Google Maps API key to the local.properties file. Open the local.properties file and add the following line:
    ```properties
    MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
    ```
   Make sure to replace your_google_maps_api_key with your actual Google Maps API key.
3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.
